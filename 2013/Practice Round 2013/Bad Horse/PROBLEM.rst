Problem
-------
As the leader of the Evil League of Evil, Bad Horse has a lot of problems to
deal with. Most recently, there have been far too many arguments and far too
much backstabbing in the League, so much so that Bad Horse has decided to split
the league into two departments in order to separate troublesome members. Being
the Thoroughbred of Sin, Bad Horse isn't about to spend his valuable time
figuring out how to split the League members by himself. That what [sic] he's
got you -- his loyal henchman -- for.

Input
-----
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test
cases follow. Each test case starts with a positive integer **M** on a line by
itself -- the number of troublesome pairs of League members. The next **M**
lines each contain a pair of names, separated by a single space.

Output
------
For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the
case number (starting from 1) and y is either "Yes" or "No", depending on
whether the League members mentioned in the input can be split into two groups
with neither of the groups containing a troublesome pair.

Limits
------
| Time limit: 60 seconds per test set.
| Memory limit: 1 GB.
| 1 ≤ **T** ≤ 100.
| Each member name will consist of only letters and the underscore character.
| Names are case-sensitive.
| No pair will appear more than once in the same test case.
| Each pair will contain two distinct League members.
